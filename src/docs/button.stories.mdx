# Button component

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs'

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Primary](?path=/docs/design-system-typography--currency-10-semi-bold)
- [Secondary](#design-system-atoms-button--secondary)
- [Large](#large)
- [Small](#small)

## With the story title defined

If you included the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

<Story id="design-system-atoms-button--primary" />

### Secondary

<Story id="design-system-atoms-button--secondary" />
