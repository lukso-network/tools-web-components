/**
  * @file Main styles (Tailwind CSS v4)
  *
  * This file contains theme configuration for Tailwind v4 applications.
  * Import this to get the same typography scale and design tokens as the web components.
  *
  * This version uses Tailwind CSS v4 syntax and does NOT include @apply directives.
  * Consumers should use utility classes directly (e.g., text-48, font-400, leading-58).
  *
  * Usage:
  * - Import the compiled main-v4.css directly in your Tailwind v4 project (recommended)
  * - Or import this .scss file in your Sass/Vite build (e.g., in Storybook)
